Serialized constructors now survive name-preserving bundler transforms (e.g. esbuild `keepNames`, which some platforms apply to hosted code downstream of the app's own build): every nested function in a `toString()`-serialized constructor uses method shorthand, so no bundle-scoped name helper leaks into payloads evaluated in realms that never loaded the bundle.
